First project from [this Serverless React, GraphQL and AWS Amplify course](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-react-with-aws-amplify/) on Udemy.

This project is a note taker that allows a user to create, delete and edit notes using a React interface and GraphQL+AWS backend. You can read my introduction to GraphQL [here](https://seccl.tech/blog/introduction-graphql/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
